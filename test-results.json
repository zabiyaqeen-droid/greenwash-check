For example, statements like 'We recognize our responsibility to the planet...' (claim_2) and 'Aspen's sustainability strategy...' (claim_3) are broad and do not delineate if initiatives apply company-wide or partially. Similarly, the scope of emissions measurement expansion (claims 21, 22) and supply chain initiatives (claims 5, 15, 36) lack precise boundaries explaining the exact parts of the business or products they cover. A few claims specify their scope more explicitly, such as the office-level electricity consumption disclosures (claim_7, 25) and specific project focus (claim_34). However, the overall lack of explicit scope disclosure raises risk for misunderstanding and potential greenwashing concerns under Bill C-59 and the Competition Bureau's guidelines.

      "status": "High Risk",
      "rationale": "The set of claims reviewed shows a general absence of stated interim targets or milestones for long-term environmental commitments. While there are commitments around emissions measurement, governance, supplier engagement, and carbon offsetting, none of the claims explicitly mention specific interim numerical targets, timelines, or milestones that would demonstrate a clear roadmap toward achieving long-term environmental goals. Some claims describe ongoing activities, strategy development, or improvements to data and governance, but these do not qualify as interim targets. For instance, claim_16 speaks about continued strategy development but without specifying milestones or interim steps. Claims largely state high-level commitments or retrospective data rather than forward-looking, measurable interim targets, which is critical for substantiating future claims under Principle 6. Therefore, there is a significant compliance gap with respect to the criterion of having defined interim targets within long-term commitments.",
