## The Four Core Standards

By becoming a signatory, organisations affirm commitment to four core standards of responsible communication:

### 1. Transparency
Clearly communicate the benefits of your product or service, ensuring no important information is concealed or omitted.

### 2. Accountability
Substantiate your claims with accurate, empirical evidence that is regularly evaluated. Share verifiable facts, figures, and statements.

### 3. Fairness
Use fair, clear, and unambiguous language when making comparisons with other products or organisations.

### 4. Honesty
Make specific, truthful statements about your progress, and ensure your actions align with your promises.

## Key Concepts

- **Green Claims Policy**: A framework for ensuring accuracy, integrity, and transparency in environmental and sustainability communications
- **Independent Validation**: Communications are independently assessed to meet Charter standards
- **Signatory Status**: Demonstrates responsible communication, avoids exaggeration, ensures claims are backed by evidence

## Alignment with Competition Bureau Principles

Key principles for credible communications:
- Crafting accurate and transparent messaging fosters trust
- Lending credibility to commitment to drive positive climate action
- Ensuring accessibility in choice of language and communication channels showcases integrity


### Common Greenwashing Tactics (Planet Mark Guide)

1. Using misleading labels, such as 'eco-friendly' or 'natural', without any substantiation or evidence
2. Spotlighting minor environmental achievements, while ignoring the overall impact of a company's operations
3. Making environmental claims with minimal verifiable proof or without third-party verification
4. Making use of images and symbols associated with nature and sustainability, to create a false impression of environmental responsibility
5. Claiming carbon neutrality solely through emissions offsetting schemes without a transparent carbon reduction strategy

### Key Statistics (EU Study)
- 53% of green claims on products and services made vague, misleading or unfounded claims
- 40% of green claims made have no supporting evidence to substantiate their evidence

### Consequences of Greenwashing
1. **Damaged brand reputation**: Undermines authenticity and credibility, breeds scepticism
2. **Regulatory fines**: Companies may face fines of at least 4% of their annual revenue
3. **Hinder progress towards decarbonisation**: Causes confusion among the public, undermining genuine efforts


### Greenhushing
- Greenhushing is the deliberate silencing of a company's environmental impacts or sustainability efforts, rather than actively promoting misleading claims
- 24% of senior decision makers from medium and large companies felt their business had under-communicated sustainability goals or initiatives since April 2022 (Earthwatch Europe)

### Key Regulatory Guidance to Be Aware Of

1. **Competition and Markets Authority Green Claims Code** (UK)
   - A guide assisting your business in understanding and meeting your current obligations under consumer protection law when communicating environmental claims

2. **Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) Advertising Guidance**
   - Guidance to help your business in complying with the regulations outlined in the ASA Advertising Codes, ensuring that environmental and social responsibility claims are accurate and transparent

3. **United Nations Integrity Matters**
   - A practical guide outlining the steps for making credible and accountable net zero pledges

4. **EU Green Claims Directive**
   - Guidance aimed at ensuring the credibility and reliability of environmental labels and claims


### Examples of Greenwashing (ASA Rulings - UK)

1. **MG Motor UK** - The ASA ruled against an MG advertisement that claimed "Zero Emissions" without providing clear context or explanation. While the ad promoted various MG vehicle models, it failed to differentiate between electric and hybrid vehicles, leading to potential consumer confusion. The ruling highlighted the importance of clarity and specificity in environmental claims, especially regarding emissions. The ASA recommended that the claim of "Zero Emissions" should only be made for fully electric vehicles and should explicitly specify that it refers to emissions while the vehicle is being driven.

2. **Anglian Water Services Ltd** - Despite portraying Anglian Water as making significant environmental contributions, such as creating wetlands and installing rainwater collection tanks, the television and video on demand ads failed to disclose their history of sewage discharge into rivers and the sea. This absence of material information, including pollution incidents and enforcement actions, led the ASA to uphold complaints against the ads. Anglian Water Services Ltd were instructed to ensure that their environmental claims are adequately qualified and don't exclude material information about their negative environmental impact in future ads.

3. **Intrepid Travel** - The ASA upheld a complaint against an advertisement by Intrepid Travel, which claimed "people & planet-friendly small group adventures since 1989." The ASA determined that the claim could mislead consumers as it did not clarify that the reference was limited to tour offerings and did not account for the environmental impact of travel to and from destinations. Intrepid Travel asserted that their carbon offsetting program and other environmental initiatives supported their claim, but the ASA found these insufficient to substantiate the claim of being "people & planet-friendly."

### Key Principle
> Companies must ensure that their environmental claims are specific, relevant, and supported by evidence to avoid greenwashing.


### Tips for Clear and Accurate Sustainability Communications

**1. Provide context to your environmental claims:**
Ensure that your environmental claims are backed by context, including clear communication of your reporting boundaries, such as emission sources and scopes of emissions, the reporting year, and the results achieved. This transparency helps to avoid ambiguity and ensures that stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of your sustainability efforts.

**2. Verify claims with trusted third parties:**
Take an evidence and data-led approach with storytelling, using third-party verification to substantiate your claims. To enhance credibility and avoid inaccuracies or bias in your environmental claims, consider verifying them with a trusted third party. These organisations operate as independent verifiers, assisting companies globally in communicating their data accurately. By undergoing third-party verification, your data is rigorously assessed before being made public, minimising doubts and bolstering trust.

### Key Definitions (Examples of Transparency)

**Embodied carbon**: The emissions that occur during manufacturing, delivering and installing the materials used to build, refurbish and fit-out a building, and their disposal at end of life. Carbon figures are typically expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a measure of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of all emissions that contribute to global warming.

**Operational carbon**: The emissions generated by building operations, such as heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hot water, computers, servers and other equipment.

**Route to zero**: What we need to do as a company, and as an industry, to reduce our operational and embodied carbon emissions to net zero.

**Near-term target**: Near-term science-based emissions reduction target set in line with climate science with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

**Net zero target**: Net zero science-based emissions reduction target approved by the SBTi.

**Net zero building**: Definition provided by the UK Net Zero Carbon Buildings Standard.


### Verified Claims Requirements

We engage reputable third-party verifiers to scrutinise our green claims for specificity and relevance, ensuring that our practices are in alignment with global sustainability standards.

**Calculating embodied carbon**: 
- Use figures from recognised databases (e.g., Inventory of Carbon & Energy version 3 (ICEv3))
- Extract quantity data for each structural system
- Multiply with corresponding embodied carbon figures
- Express calculations in figures per square metre
- Third-Party Verifier: ICE database

**Emissions Reduction Targets**:
- Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) approved near-term science-based emissions reduction target
- Commitment to set long-term emissions reduction targets


### Imagery & Colour Standards

Our visual content undergoes a review by the marketing team to ensure that imagery aligns with the principles of authenticity and transparency.

Key requirements:
