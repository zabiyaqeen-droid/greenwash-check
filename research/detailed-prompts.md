# Detailed Assessment Prompts for Greenwash Check

Based on Competition Bureau Canada's Six Principles (Bill C-59) and The Anti-Greenwash Charter's Four Standards.

## Principle 1: Be Truthful (Competition Bureau Principle 1)
*Aligned with Anti-Greenwash Charter: Transparency & Honesty*

### Subcategory 1.1: Literal Truth Assessment

**Prompt:**
Evaluate whether the environmental claims in this document are literally true. For each claim identified:

1. **Factual Accuracy (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: All claims are verifiably accurate with no factual errors
   - 16-20: Claims are mostly accurate with minor imprecisions that don't materially affect meaning
   - 11-15: Some claims contain inaccuracies that could mislead but are not fundamentally false
   - 6-10: Multiple claims contain significant inaccuracies
   - 0-5: Claims contain demonstrably false statements

2. **Completeness of Information (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: All material information necessary for accurate understanding is included
   - 16-20: Most material information is present; minor omissions don't affect overall accuracy
   - 11-15: Some material information is omitted but core claims remain defensible
   - 6-10: Significant material information is omitted, creating misleading impressions
   - 0-5: Critical information is concealed or omitted, rendering claims deceptive

**Scoring Range: 0-50 points**
**Weight: 1.0**

---

### Subcategory 1.2: General Impression Assessment

**Prompt:**
Assess the general impression conveyed by the environmental claims, considering not just literal meaning but the overall message received by a reasonable consumer. Per Competition Bureau guidance, examine the entirety of the representation including words, phrases, text display, visual elements, and context.

1. **Alignment Between Literal Meaning and General Impression (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: General impression accurately reflects the literal claims; no exaggeration or minimisation
   - 16-20: General impression is consistent with literal claims with only minor discrepancies
   - 11-15: Some disconnect between literal claims and general impression; potential for consumer confusion
   - 6-10: General impression significantly overstates environmental benefits compared to literal claims
   - 0-5: General impression is materially misleading despite technically accurate literal statements

2. **Visual and Contextual Honesty (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: Imagery, colours, and design elements accurately represent environmental attributes; no misleading nature imagery or green colour schemes that overstate benefits
   - 16-20: Visual elements are generally appropriate with minor concerns about implied benefits
   - 11-15: Some visual elements may create impressions of greater environmental benefit than substantiated
   - 6-10: Visual presentation creates materially misleading impressions about environmental performance
   - 0-5: Imagery and design deliberately create false impressions of environmental responsibility

**Scoring Range: 0-50 points**
**Weight: 1.0**

---

### Subcategory 1.3: Material Disclosure Assessment

**Prompt:**
Evaluate whether all material information necessary for consumers not to be deceived is included as an integral part of the representation. Per Competition Bureau guidance, material information is information that could influence consumer behaviour.

1. **Disclosure of Limitations and Qualifications (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: All limitations, qualifications, and conditions are clearly disclosed as integral parts of claims
   - 16-20: Most limitations are disclosed; minor qualifications may be in fine print but are accessible
   - 11-15: Some important limitations are disclosed but not prominently; reliance on disclaimers
   - 6-10: Significant limitations are buried in fine print or not disclosed at all
   - 0-5: Material limitations are concealed or actively hidden from consumers

2. **Negative Impact Disclosure (0-25 points):**
   - 21-25: Any negative environmental impacts are transparently disclosed alongside positive claims
   - 16-20: Most negative impacts are acknowledged; minor omissions don't materially affect understanding
   - 11-15: Some negative impacts are omitted but overall picture is not fundamentally misleading
   - 6-10: Significant negative impacts are omitted while positive aspects are emphasised
   - 0-5: Material negative information is concealed while making positive environmental claims

**Scoring Range: 0-50 points**
**Weight: 1.0**

   - 6-10: Limited substantiation with questionable or undisclosed methodology
   - 0-5: No substantiation or testing evident; claims appear to be unsubstantiated assertions

2. **Third-Party Verification (0-25 points):**
