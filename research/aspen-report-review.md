## Assessment: Is "0 claims found" accurate?

**ABSOLUTELY NOT.** This document is FULL of environmental and sustainability claims:

3. Sustainability strategy claims
4. Environmental stewardship claims
5. Low carbon economy transition claims
6. Supply chain sustainability claims

The tool's failure to find ANY claims is a **critical bug** that needs immediate fixing.

## Potential Greenwashing Concerns

2. **No baseline data:** Claims about "improving" without stating from what baseline
3. **Future-oriented claims:** "transition paths towards a low carbon economy" - no timeline or targets
4. **Missing scope 1 & 3:** Only mentions scope 2 emissions accuracy
5. **No third-party verification mentioned** in first 5 pages
